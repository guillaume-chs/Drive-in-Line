# Drive-in-Line
Github proposed me *"miniature-octo-wookie"*... I prefered ***"Drive in Line"***.

The idea is : **"A Google Drive client for Linux"**.

From there, I thought : *"Oh, a G-Drive client, in Linux"*... Then *"G-Drive in Linux"*...

And so it became ***"Drive in Line"***.
I think I traded any possible sense for the beauty of the expression.
